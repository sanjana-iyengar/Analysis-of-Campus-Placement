# Analysis of Campus Placement

Campus recruitment is a strategy for sourcing, engaging and hiring young talent for internship and entry-level positions. College recruiting is typically a tactic for medium- to large-sized companies with high-volume recruiting needs, but can range from small efforts (like working with university career centers to source potential candidates) to large-scale operations (like visiting a wide array of colleges and attending recruiting events throughout the spring and fall semester). Campus recruitment often involves working with university career services centers and attending career fairs to meet in-person with college students and recent graduates.

The data set consists of Placement data of students . It includes secondary and higher secondary school percentage and specialization. It also includes degree specialization, type and Work experience and salary offers to the placed students.

Questions we will be answering:
- Which factor influenced a candidate in getting placed?
- Does percentage matters for one to get placed?
- Which degree specialization is much demanded by corporate?
- Does work experience matter for one to get placed?
- Play with the data conducting all statistical tests.

In this project we are going to visualize the chances and possibility for a candidate getting placed in a company based on the factors given below:

1.Work experience

2.10th grade percentage

3.12th Grade percentage

4.Degree percentage

5.Gender

6.Field of Degree
